Follow the instructions in the next section to get your project set up properly. Creating a commit for each of the tasks is suggested. Get back to us once you're confident with your code and remember - it is the quality of your code and the way you approach the problems that matter the most, not whether you've completed all the tasks and how fast! ðŸ˜‰

## Getting started
